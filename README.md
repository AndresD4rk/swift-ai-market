## Project Overview

This is a modern e-commerce application built with React, TypeScript, and Supabase, featuring AI-powered product recommendations using Google's Gemini API. The application includes an AI shopping assistant, real-time admin dashboard, and comprehensive session management.

## Architecture Overview

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: Custom hooks with local state
- **Routing**: React Router DOM

### Backend Architecture
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication**: Currently no authentication system
- **API**: Supabase Edge Functions (Deno runtime)
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini API for chat functionality
- **Vector Search**: PostgreSQL with pgvector extension

### Key Components

#### 1. Product Management
- **Products Table**: Stores product information with vector embeddings
- **Vector Search**: Uses cosine similarity for product recommendations
- **Categories**: Dynamic category filtering from product data

#### 2. AI Assistant
- **Chat Interface**: Real-time conversation with Gemini AI
- **Product Integration**: AI can recommend and display relevant products
- **Context Awareness**: Maintains conversation history and product context

#### 3. Session Management
- **Active Sessions**: Tracks user interactions with products
- **Inactivity Detection**: Automatically ends sessions after 5 minutes of inactivity
- **Cleanup System**: Background process to clean up stale sessions

#### 4. Admin Dashboard
- **Real-time Metrics**: Live view of active sessions and popular products
- **Product Management**: CREATE operations for products
- **Session Analytics**: Visualizes user engagement patterns

## Problem-Solving Approach

### 1. AI Integration Challenges

**Problem**: Integrating AI recommendations with product catalog
**Solution**: 
- Created vector embeddings for products using Gemini API
- Implemented similarity search with configurable thresholds (0.7 default)
- Built context-aware chat that can suggest relevant products

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Vector search with similarity threshold
const relevantProducts = data.contextProducts.filter((product: any) => 
  product.similarity >= 0.7
);
```

### 2. Session Management

**Problem**: Tracking user engagement without authentication
**Solution**:
- Created anonymous session system with unique identifiers
- Implemented inactivity detection using multiple event listeners
- Added cleanup mechanisms for stale sessions

**Key Features**:
- 5-minute inactivity timeout
- Automatic session cleanup every 2 minutes
- Browser close detection with sendBeacon API

### 3. Real-time Admin Dashboard

**Problem**: Providing real-time insights for administrators
**Solution**:
- Built custom hooks for data fetching with React Query
- Created reusable chart components with Recharts
- Implemented automatic data refresh for live metrics

### 4. Product Discovery

**Problem**: Helping users find relevant products efficiently
**Solution**:
- Multi-layered search: text search, category filtering, AI recommendations
- Smart product suggestions based on user queries
- Visual product cards with detailed information

## Technical Debt & Refactoring Opportunities

### File Size Concerns
- `src/pages/Index.tsx` (211 lines) - Should be broken into smaller components
- Consider extracting search, filter, and product grid logic

### Code Organization
- Move business logic from components to custom hooks
- Create shared utilities for common operations
- Implement proper error boundaries

### Performance Optimizations
- Implement virtual scrolling for large product lists
- Add image lazy loading
- Optimize bundle size with code splitting

## Development Workflow

### Getting Started
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Environment Setup
1. Configure Supabase project
2. Set up Gemini API key
3. Run database migrations
4. Generate vector embeddings for products

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for utility functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for critical user flows

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Performance Metrics
- Page load times
- API response times
- Database query performance
- AI response latency

### Business Metrics
- User engagement with AI assistant
- Product recommendation accuracy
- Session duration and conversion rates

### Operational Concerns
- Database storage growth (vector embeddings)
- API usage costs (Gemini API)
- Session cleanup efficiency

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a solid foundation for a modern e-commerce platform with AI capabilities. The architecture is well-structured and follows React best practices. However, significant security improvements are needed before production deployment, particularly around authentication, authorization, and data protection.

The session management system and AI integration are innovative features that provide real value to both users and administrators. With proper security measures in place, this application has the potential to be a robust, scalable e-commerce solution.
